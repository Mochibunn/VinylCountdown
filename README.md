## Our story..
Now this is a story all about how we wrote this project ~~upside-down~~
</br>

This project is aimed at showcasing our ability to use `API`s📜 and implement a headless `CMS`🧠 for a website

This project is built using <a href="https://react.dev/"><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a7/React-icon.svg" alt="React icon" height="16px"/> **React**</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FvOpPeKSf_4"><img src="https://svgur.com/i/9YV.svg" alt="Question Mark Logo" height="16px" style="margin-right:1%"/>**A currently mysterious component**</a>

We're coding together,</br>
And it is all well</br>
And maybe our project's</br>
Top notch, who can tell?</br>
I guess there is no one to blame</br>
We're coding stuff</br>
Will things ever be the same again?</br>
</br>
It's the Vinyl Countdown!
